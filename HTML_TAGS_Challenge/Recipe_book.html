    <h2 id="jollof">Jollof Rice</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Jollof rice, at its core, is rice cooked with tomato, onion, pepper, and spices.

        This ubiquitous dish is present on both special occasions and regular meals. <br>

        Not only is this dish popular in Nigeria but in other African countries as well. For example, you’ll find it on many roundups featuring Ghanaian Foods. <br>

        With its rich flavors, I’m not surprised why. Other variations include vegetables or a type of meat, such as beef, fish, or chicken. <br>

    <h2 id="egusi">Egusi Soup</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Egusi soup is a Nigerian delicacy that features ground melon or pumpkin seeds as its main ingredient. 

        Other ingredients include meat or seafood, fermented beans, onions, and vegetables.
        
        The combination of ingredients makes for a flavorful soup. <br>
        
        Thanks to the pumpkin seeds (egusi), this soup has a wonderful nuttiness to it. The rest of the ingredients add salty, savory, and spicy flavors as well. <br>
        
        The hearty soup is most commonly eaten with pounded yam, which is a dough-based dish made of, surprise – pounded yam. <br>

    <h2 id="tomatoe">Nigerian Tomatoe Stew</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Nigerian tomato stew has a lovely red hue and delicious bold flavors. 

        With rich tomatoes as its flavor base, this stew is truly enticing.

        Additional flavor agents include onions, bouillon, curry, thyme, garlic, and peppers. <br>

        What gives its distinct flavor, though, is the gamey ram.

        Because it’s very expensive, this protein is considered celebratory meat and is often only served during special occasions, such as the Islamic holiday, Eid-el Kabir. <br>

    <h2 id="ogbono">Ogbono Soup</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Ogbono soup has a slippery texture and a rich flavor. It’s also sometimes referred to as “draw soup,” because of its mucilaginous texture. 

        Admittedly, the consistency takes a bit of getting used to, but once you do, you’ll fall hard. <br>
        
        It gets its distinct texture from ogbono, a type of wild mango. Interestingly, it’s the seeds that are added, not the flesh.
        
        Besides the ogbono seeds, the soup also features dried fish, stockfish, assorted meat, and spices. <br>
        
        The different ingredients combine to create a medley of flavors and textures.
        
        Ogbono soup is typically eaten with eba, pounded yam, or fufu. <br>

    </p>

    <h2 id="salad">Nigerian Salad</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Nigerian salad is a colorful appetizer that features a myriad of raw and cooked vegetables, beans, pasta, eggs, and a lot more.

        The vegetables typically include lettuce, cabbage, tomatoes, cucumber, and corn. <br>

        From the colors to the flavors to the textures, this salad gets 10s across the board.

        Since it’s very hearty, it can be served as a meal on its own. But it’s also commonly paired with jollof rice or fried chicken. <br>

    </p>

    <h2 id="tuwo">Rice Tuwo (Tuwo Shinkafa)</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Tuwo shinkafa is a type of rice pudding. It’s neither sweet nor savory, though. The only two ingredients in the recipe are rice and water. <br>

        Unlike other rice recipes, you want your rice to be super soft and mushy to achieve the perfect tuwo. 

        Once cooked, the rice is mashed and formed into balls. It’s then served alongside soup or stew. <br>

        <img src="https://img-global.cpcdn.com/recipes/f791c83e9838eb69/1360x964cq70/tuwo-shinkafa-n-vegetable-soup-recipe-main-photo.webp" alt="Tuwo shinkafa photo" width="300">
    </p>

    <h2 id="boli">Boli</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Boli is a delicious dish made of ripe plantains. They’re either baked, grilled, or roasted.

        Either way, cooking the fruit enhances its sweetness and forms a delicious outer crust. <br>
        
        Because there’s very little oil involved, they’re a much healthier version of the deep-fried plantains. <br>
        
        Just sprinkle the plantains with salt and olive oil, and they’re good to go.
        
        Serve boli with a side of guacamole, and you’ll have a tasty and nutritious breakfast! <br>
