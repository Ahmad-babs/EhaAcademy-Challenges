    <p>
        Nobody's born <em>smart</em>. We all start at 0. Can't talk, can't walk, certainly can't do algebra. <br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <strong>Nobody's good at anything at first.</strong> <br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn't count to 10. <br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us. <br>
        Thankfully, we are born to <strong><em>learn</em></strong>. <br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall. <br>
        Frustrating, confusing, Trying. Struggling. <br>
        Until one day, you walk. <br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next. <br>
        wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger. <br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going. <br>
        <em>This is Learning</em>. <br>
        It's not that you don't get it. <br>
        You just don't get it, <strong>yet.</strong> <br>
        Because the most beautiful, complex concept in the whole universe <br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand. <br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        You only have to know one thing: <br>
        <strong><em>You can learn anything</em>.</strong>
