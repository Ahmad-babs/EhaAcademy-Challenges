  <P>
    <strong>Madinah</strong> is the second holiest city on earth and is very highly regarded in Islam. <br> It is located 400km north of Mecca, in the west of Saudi Arabia. <br> People from all over the world come to visit it every year during the <em>Holy Hajj</em> and Umrah pilgrimage. <br> On their trip, they wish to cover all the important places to visit in Madinah.
  </p>

  <p>
The city is not only adorned with mesmerising views but also houses various historical places that the pilgrims can visit during their pilgrimage journey or on vacation. <br> Before the rise of Islam, this city was originally known as Yathrib and was renamed as <strong><em>Madinat an-Nabi</em></strong> (the Prophet’s City or city of the Prophet) after <em>Prophet Mohammad’s</em> death and later as <strong>al-Madinah al-Munawwarah</strong> (The Enlightened City). <br> Not only is it the city with the fourth highest population but is also the capital of Madinah Province of Saudi Arabia.

 <p>
The <em>prophet Mohammed's</em> birthplace is Islam's spiritual center and is strictly off-limits to non-Muslims. <br> The pillars of Islam state that all Muslims with the means must undertake <strong>Hajj</strong>, a pilgrimage to Mecca, <em>once in their lifetime</em>. <br> Those who visit the holy city are rewarded not just by proximity to landmarks and religious sites crucial to the religion, such as the Masjid Al Haram (Holy Mosque), the Mountain of Light, the Black Stone and the Well of Zamzam, <strong>but with the forgiveness of all their sins.</strong>
